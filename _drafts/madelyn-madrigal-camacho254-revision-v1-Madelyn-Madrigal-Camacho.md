#### DESCRIPTION OF RESEARCH:

<span data-sheets-userformat="{"2":961,"3":{"1":0},"9":0,"10":0,"11":4,"12":0}" data-sheets-value="{"1":2,"2":"The field of metal additive manufacturing (MAM) is rapidly advancing; however, it faces several challenges including the development and production of new alloy systems and powder composite manufacturing methods. Previous studies have investigated metal matrix composites produced by selective laser melting (SLM) which resulted in finer grains, improved hardness, and tensile strength due to the homogeneous distribution of reinforcement particles. Madelyn's research investigates the viability of ball milling and laser sintering for CoCr composites reinforced by WC or SiC dispersoids. The particle size, flowability, microstructure, and composition of the CoCr-WC and CoCr-SiC powders are compared with post sintered samples to probe the microstructural evolution during laser processing. The observations point to the applicability of high energy ball milling as a platform for alloy and composite design for MAM."}">The field of metal additive manufacturing (MAM) is rapidly advancing; however, it faces several challenges including the development and production of new alloy systems and powder composite manufacturing methods.
